## Introduction

This paper presents a movie recommendation analysis using collaborative filtering. The goal is to enhance the movie-watching experience by providing personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and ratings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the MovieLens dataset. The dataset can be obtained from the MovieLens website at MovieLens Dataset. It provides a collection of movie ratings and user information, allowing us to analyze user preferences and generate accurate movie recommendations. The dataset includes the following fields:

User ID
Movie ID
Rating
Timestamp
Additional movie metadata (e.g., title, genre)

## Technical Details

I've leveraged Apache Spark and its collaborative filtering algorithm for this analysis. The implementation used Spark's MLlib library for efficient and scalable machine learning.

## Results

My movie recommender system successfully provided personalized recommendations for users in various scenarios. It accurately predicted user preferences and accommodated users with diverse ratings.

## Insight

Users tend to prefer highly rated and popular movies. Leveraging collaborative filtering can enhance user satisfaction and engagement on movie platforms.
